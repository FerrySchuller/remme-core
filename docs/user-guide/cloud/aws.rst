Step 2: launch instance
=======================

``Amazon EC2`` provides a wide selection of instance types optimized to fit different use cases. Instances are virtual
servers that can run applications. They have varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity,
and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications. Learn more about instance
types and how they can meet your computing needs.

Type ``Ubuntu 16.04 LTS`` into the search bar, choose ``AWS Marketplace`` and select image ``Ubuntu 16.04 LTS - Xenial (HVM)``,
which should be regarded as an operating system, then in the window that appears click ``Continue``.

Step 5: start the project
=========================

Copy commands below and paste it into the terminal. You can change the value of ``REMME_CORE_RELEASE`` below, just take
a look at our `release list <https://github.com/Remmeauth/remme-core/releases>`_. We would recommend the latest version of
the project that already specified in the command below.

.. code-block:: console

   $ export REMME_CORE_RELEASE=0.7.0-alpha
   $ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common make -y && \
         echo "REMME_CORE_RELEASE=$REMME_CORE_RELEASE" >> ~/.bashrc && \
         cd /home/ && curl -L https://github.com/Remmeauth/remme-core/archive/v$REMME_CORE_RELEASE.tar.gz | sudo tar zx && \
         cd remme-core-$REMME_CORE_RELEASE && \
         sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && \
         curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - && \
         sudo apt update && \
         sudo apt install nginx docker.io -y && \
         curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dmytrostriletskyi/ba920936805f5516e9dcbaaf9ade9e02/raw/f1f207768868f48c03efcb0210df3c50168d220a/node-grafana-nginx.config | sudo tee /etc/nginx/nginx.conf > /dev/null && \
         sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" && \
         sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && \
         curl -L https://github.com/dmytrostriletskyi/remme-mon-stack/archive/v1.2.0.tar.gz | sudo tar zx && \
         sudo docker-compose -f remme-mon-stack-1.2.0/docker-compose.yml up -d && \
         sudo make run_genesis_bg && \
         sudo systemctl restart nginx

   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   :alt: Proof core is up

To check if your node has completed a correct setup, use the following commands, being logged in your instance. Remember to
change ``157.230.146.230`` to your server's ``IP address``.

.. code-block:: console

   $ export NODE_IP_ADDRESS=157.230.146.230
   $ curl -X POST http://$NODE_IP_ADDRESS:8080 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
         '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"11","method":"get_node_config","params":{}}' | python3 -m json.tool

The response should look similar to this:

.. code-block:: console

   {
       "id": "11",
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "result": {
           "node_public_key": "028e7e9b060d7c407e428676299ced9afef4ce782995294d8ea01fd0f08cec9765"
       }
   }

The flow is illustrated below.

Step 6: monitoring
==================

Another option to check if your node has completed a correct setup is the monitoring. While starting the node, the monitoring also
has been installed and started. **Completing this step is required**.

Monitoring is a process of tracking application performance to detect and prevent issues that could happen with your application
on a particular server. For the monitoring, we will use ``Grafana``. |grafana| is an open source, feature-rich metrics dashboard
and graph editor.

.. |grafana| raw:: html

   <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a>

Copy your server's ``IP address``, paste it into the browser address bar. Then add ``/grafana/`` to the end of the address and press ``Enter``.
Then you will see initial ``Grafana`` page with authentication. Enter ``admin`` to the ``User`` and ``Password`` fields.

.. image:: /img/user-guide/advanced-guide/monitoring/login.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   :alt: Login to the Grafana

After entering the initial credentials you will reach the main page. Click on ``Main Dashboard`` to open monitoring graphs for
your node.

.. image:: /img/user-guide/advanced-guide/monitoring/main-dashboard.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   :alt: Go to the Grafana main dashboard button

Here you will find information about uptime, CPU cores and their load, memory and its load, storage and its load. Also,
information about containers (components of the node) is presented on the right side of the page. Information
about container includes numbers on how much CPU each uses, and so on.

.. image:: /img/user-guide/advanced-guide/monitoring/dashboard.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   :alt: Grafana dashboard

You should then personalize your your credentials. Go to the profile page.

.. image:: /img/user-guide/advanced-guide/monitoring/go-to-profile.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   :alt: Go to the Grafana profile button

Change the name, email and username. Also, the preferences can be changed to suit your user interface needs.
