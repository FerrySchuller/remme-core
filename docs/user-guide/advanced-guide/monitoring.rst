Monitoring
==========

Monitoring is a process of tracking application performance to detect and prevent issues that could happen with your application
on a particular server. For the monitoring, we will use ``Grafana``. |grafana|  is an open source, feature-rich metrics dashboard
and graph editor.

First of all, login to the server as you previously did during installation of the node. Remember to change ``68.183.137.173``
to your server's ``IP address``.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ssh root@68.183.137.173

The flow is illustrated below.

Copy the command below and paste it into the terminal.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd /home/remme-core-$REMME_CORE_RELEASE && \
         curl -L https://github.com/Remmeauth/remme-mon-stack/archive/v1.0.0.tar.gz | sudo tar zx && \
         cd remme-mon-stack-1.0.0 && \
         sudo docker-compose up -d

Copy the ``IP address`` and paste it into the browser address bar. Enter ``admin`` to the ``User`` and ``Password`` fields.

After entering the initial credentials you will reach the main page. Click on ``Main Dashboard`` to open monitoring graphs for
your node.

Here you will find information about uptime, CPU cores and their load, memory and its load, storage and its load. Also,
information about containers (components of the node) is presented on the right side of the page. Information
about container includes numbers on how much CPU each uses, and so on.

To stop monitoring, use the ``sudo docker-compose stop`` terminal command.
