Command line notation
=====================

Throughout the documentation, we’ll show some commands used in the terminal. Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with ``$``.
You don’t need to type in the ``$`` character, it indicates the start of each command. Lines that don’t start with ``$`` typically show
the output of the previous command.

The typical command line interface looks like this. There two separated commands, so you should enter it one by one.

.. code-block:: console

   $ export REMME_CORE_RELEASE=0.7.0-alpha
   $ sudo make run_bg
